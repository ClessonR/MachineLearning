Chapter 1 Exercises.
1. Machine learning is a technique to instruct a machine through code, 
on how to perform an activity.
2. Data Augmentation, Values Predictions, AI, and repetition tasks.
3. A labeled traning set is a dataset whom has labels with right answers of what is expected.
4. Classification and Regression.
5. Visualization, Diemsionality Reduction, Anomaly Detection, and Clustering.
6. Reinforcement learning
7. Clustering.
8. It depends on the traning dataset
9. A system that continues to learn with new inputs.
10. Out-of-core learning splits the data into multiple batches, and it uses them to 
train the model trough online learning.
11. An instance-based learning system.
12. A model has one or more model parameters that determine what it will 
predict given a new instance (e.g., the slope of a linear model). A learning algorithm 
tries to find optimal values for these parameters such that the model generalizes well to new instances. A hyperparameter is a parameter 
of the learning algorithm itself, not of the model (e.g., the amount of regularization to apply).
13. Data that does not have new features,
